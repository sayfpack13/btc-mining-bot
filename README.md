# btc-mining-bot

A simple selenium java project for mining bitcoin online using free mining web services.


Usage:

1) Create as many accounts as you can on this website:
https://app.stormgain.com/

2) Save all of your accounts and paste them into the main.java -> accounts variable or you can modify and import them from an external file

4) You can use cookies, which is not necessary because I only added them to bypass the cloudflare protection of other websites

6) Build the executable .JAR file and you're ready to go

=======================================================================================
Requirements:

1) selenium library (java):
https://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/3.141/selenium-java-3.141.59.zip

2) free/paid vps from azure/google/aws, you can google for free vps methods.... i will upload my own methods if you are interested :)

=======================================================================================
VARS:

accounts // accounts list

enable_cookies // use cookies ?

silent_mode // gui mode or silent mode

times // how many times repeat the same mining process

sleep //hours between mining process

max_attempts // if something wrong happened how many times we can try it again


=======================================================================================
imagine using only 1 account, how much you can earn per month:
you can earn 0.0247321428571429$ / hour
that means you can earn up to 4$ / week
and 16$ / month



what about creating and using 10 accounts ?

it's hard for me to calculate it but you......

give it a try.
